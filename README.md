Welcome to the Team RH Technical Test!

Thank you for taking the time out of your day for the initial interview, and we appreciate you putting together this short take-home test. 

For this tech-test, we have created a sample app that has a list of items. Each item has the following identifiers set:
* Item container - ListItemCard_${index}
* Item title text - ListItemText_${index}
* Item caption text - ListItemDesc_${index}

**Debug APK under test - teamrh-sample-app.apk**

## Task: 
Create a test framework using Appium using Javascript and write tests for the above app. 
Coding language - Feel free to choose laguage of your choice

Once completed please share your project on Github with Suman Bala, Lead QE (suman.bala@teamrhfitness.com) and Ciaran Sloan, Lead Android Engineer (ciaran.sloan@teamrhfitness.com) along with a README that contains a brief description of your implementation and what you would like to have added if you had more time.
